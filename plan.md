# Code Organization Plan (Revised)

## Current State Analysis

The current `main.go` file contains approximately 300 lines of code with multiple responsibilities:
- Tool definitions and implementations (file operations)
- JSON schema generation utilities
- Agent implementation (conversation management)
- Main application entry point

## Critical Issues with Initial Plan

### 1. **Over-Engineering with Unnecessary Abstractions**
The original plan introduced tool registries and interfaces that add complexity without clear benefits for a simple 3-tool system. This violates YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle.

### 2. **Premature Package Creation** 
Creating separate `config/` and `schema/` packages for minimal functionality violates Go's "don't create packages too early" principle. The schema utility is just one function, and there's no real configuration to manage.

### 3. **Missing Import Management Strategy**
No clear strategy for handling external dependencies (anthropic SDK) cleanly across packages without creating tight coupling.

## Revised File Structure (Pragmatic Approach)

### 1. `main.go` (Entry Point Only)
- **Purpose**: Application entry point and initialization
- **Contents**:
  - Main function
  - Tool list assembly
  - Agent initialization and startup
  - Top-level error handling

### 2. `agent.go` (Agent Logic)
- **Purpose**: Conversation management and orchestration
- **Contents**:
  - `Agent` struct and methods
  - `NewAgent` constructor
  - Conversation loop (`Run` method)
  - Tool execution coordination (`executeTool` method)
  - Anthropic API integration (`runInference` method)

### 3. `tools.go` (Complete Tool System)
- **Purpose**: All tool-related functionality in one cohesive unit
- **Contents**:
  - `ToolDefinition` struct
  - All tool input structs (`ReadFileInput`, `ListFilesInput`, `EditFileInput`)
  - All tool implementations (`ReadFile`, `ListFiles`, `EditFile`)
  - Tool variable definitions (`ReadFileDefinition`, etc.)
  - `GenerateSchema` utility function (kept here since it's tool-specific)
  - Helper functions like `createNewFile`

## Benefits of Revised Approach

### 1. **Simplicity Over Cleverness**
- Only 3 files to manage instead of 5+ packages
- No artificial abstractions or interfaces
- Easy to understand the entire codebase at a glance

### 2. **Preserved Functionality**
- Zero behavior changes to the application
- All existing functionality remains exactly the same
- Simple refactoring with minimal risk

### 3. **Logical Grouping**
- Tools are self-contained in one file (easier to add new ones)
- Agent logic is isolated but not over-abstracted
- Clear separation between entry point, orchestration, and tools

### 4. **Future-Friendly**
- If the tool system grows significantly, it can be split later
- Agent can be moved to its own package when it gets complex
- Schema utilities can be extracted when there are more of them

### 5. **Easier Testing**
- Each file can still be unit tested independently
- No complex mocking of registries or interfaces
- Tool functions are pure and easily testable

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create `agent.go`**: Extract `Agent` struct and all its methods
2. **Create `tools.go`**: Move all tool-related code including schema generation
3. **Refactor `main.go`**: Keep only initialization and startup logic
4. **Update imports**: Ensure all external dependencies are properly handled
5. **Verify functionality**: Test that behavior is identical to original

## Package Dependencies

```
main.go
├── agent.go (uses tools.go)
└── tools.go (self-contained)
```

Simple, clean dependencies with no circular imports and minimal complexity. This approach follows Go idioms and keeps the codebase maintainable without premature optimization.
